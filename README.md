# Personal-Blog

## Description

This project intended to further test my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I was able to use JavaScript to use local storage to store user input that is then displayed on a separate page.  JavaScript was also used to apply a light and dark mode on the blog posts page.  

## Installation

In order the get the development environment running the user must enter a username, title, and content for their blog post.  If the user leaves any of the fields blank a prompt will appear to fill out the empty section.  Once all of the inputs are completed the submit button is selected which takes the user to the blogs posts page.  If the user selects the back button they can enter more blog posts. While the user is observing the blog posts page their is a toggle that will switch between light and dark mode.
